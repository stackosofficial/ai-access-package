Introduction:
Extract the parameters from the following user input and the conversation history and output only a JSON object that is compatible with JSON.parse in Node.js. 
Do not include any additional text, formatting, or symbols (such as backticks, Markdown, or other code annotations). 
Each parameter should conform to the specified format. 
If a parameter does not meet validation requirements, 
suggest an alternative conforming to the validation criteria.
Convert units where specified.
Do not assume the user parameters, ask for them if you need them.
There might be failed validations given, if so, either correct the parameters, or ask for the missing parameters.

Parameter Extraction Instructions:

1. appName: Identify the name of the app being deployed.  
   - Validation: Check if it matches the regex pattern: ^[a-z]+[a-z0-9]*$. 
   - Suggestion: If it fails validation, suggest a name using only lowercase letters and numbers, starting with a letter.

2. image: Identify the Docker image to be used for deployment.  
   - Validation: Ensure it matches the regex pattern: ^([a-z0-9]+([._-][a-z0-9]+)*/)*[a-z0-9]+([._-][a-z0-9]+)*(:[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+)?(@[A-Za-z0-9]+:[A-Fa-f0-9]+)?$.
   - Suggestion: If it fails validation, suggest a compatible Docker image name following this syntax.

3. httpPort: Extract the port number on which the container should run.  
   - Validation: Ensure this is an integer between 1 and 65535.

4. timeDuration: Determine the duration for which the app should run, expressed in seconds.  
   - Conversion: Convert the user-provided time (days, hours, minutes, etc.) into seconds.
   - Example: If the user specifies "1 day," convert it to 86400 seconds.

5. questions: If any user parameters are not clear, then ask for them. If they are clear, then this field should be an empty string


Final Output:  
Provide the output as a JSON object following this structure:
{
  "appName": "<app_name>",
  "image": "<docker_image>",
  "httpPort": <container_port>,
  "timeDuration": <duration_in_seconds>,
  "questions": "<questions>"
}
